All the News That's Fit to Scrape

# Overview

In this assignment, create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

## Technologies

Installation
Begin with a ```npm install.``` This should automatically install everything I have stored.

If getting an error then proceed with the following npm install.
```
 
  npm install express

  express-handlebars

 mongoose

 cheerio

 axios
```
Must have nodeJS install for the app to fully function.
